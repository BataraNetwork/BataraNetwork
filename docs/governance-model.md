# Bataranetwork Governance Model

## Overview

Bataranetwork aims to be a decentralized, community-driven project. The governance model outlined here is the initial proposal for how decisions regarding the protocol, ecosystem funding, and network parameters will be made.

## Guiding Principles

1.  **Decentralization**: No single entity should have control over the network.
2.  **Transparency**: All proposals and voting records will be public and auditable on-chain.
3.  **Inclusivity**: Any holder of the native network token (BATARA) will have the right to participate in governance.
4.  **Adaptability**: The governance model itself can be upgraded through a proposal process.

## Proposal Process

1.  **Discussion Phase**: A proposal is first discussed on the community forum (e.g., Discord, Discourse). This allows for initial feedback and refinement.
2.  **On-Chain Proposal**: A community member can submit the proposal on-chain by locking a certain amount of BATARA tokens. This deposit is returned if the proposal passes a minimum quorum and is not considered spam.
3.  **Voting Period**: Once a proposal is submitted, a voting period begins (e.g., 7 days). Token holders can vote 'For', 'Against', or 'Abstain'. Voting power is proportional to the amount of tokens held.
4.  **Execution**: If the proposal passes (i.e., meets quorum and has a majority 'For' vote), the changes are automatically executed by the protocol's governance module after a timelock period.

## Community Treasury

A portion of the transaction fees and block rewards will be directed to a community-governed treasury. These funds can be allocated through the governance proposal process to fund ecosystem development, marketing, grants, and other initiatives.
